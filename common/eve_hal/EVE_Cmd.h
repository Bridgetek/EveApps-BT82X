 * @brief EVE's command read/write
 
 * This file defines the generic APIs of phost access layer for the BT820 or EVE compatible silicon.
 * Application shall access BT820 or EVE resources over these APIs,regardless of I2C or SPI protocol.
 * In addition, there are some helper functions defined for coprocessor engine as well as phost commands.
