# EveApps-BT82X
EveApps-BT82X is a collection of applications designed as reference resources for Bridgetek's 5th-generation graphics controller, the BT82X.

The collection is divided into two categories: **Sample** and **Demo** applications. Both are written in ANSI C, with complete source code provided.

- **Sample applications** focus on instructional use, demonstrating individual display lists or commands. 
- **Demo applications** are more complex, closely resembling real-world projects.  (To be updated) 

All applications rely on shared resources located in the "common" folder.

Each application includes a "project" subfolder containing the necessary files for building the application using the MS Visual Studio 2019.

Users are expected to have familiarity with the BT82X programming guide and datasheet.

Note:
- For Eve registers and commands/instructions definition, user can find it at the file common/eve_hal/EVE_GpuDef.h and common/eve_hal/Eve_CoCmd.h.
- For flash blob file used to access the eve connected flash chip, user can find it at common/eve_flash.

## Hardware dependency 
Unless specified otherwise, the default hardware platform is the VM820C.  You may refer to the details at www.brtchip.com

## Build instructions

### FT4222 and MPSSE
#### Way 1: Open SampleApp_MSVC.sln

Go to property

![property](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/953dd3b1-3a9b-4747-ae0d-1daeda844b94)

Change settings (EVE_PLATFORM_FT4222 / EVE_PLATFORM_MPSSE)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9dd29dea-abd3-4a09-a5f6-31b4f318d41a)

press F5 to build and run

#### Way 2: Use Cmake: (Need Cmake 3.19 installed)
```sh
# Launch the appropriate Developer Command Prompt for VS
# For 64-bit build, open:
# x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS
call "[path to VS]\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"   # for 64-bit
# For 32-bit build, open:
# x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS
call "[path to VS]\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars32.bat"   # for 32-bit

cd [path to EveApps]
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DEVE_APPS_PLATFORM=EVE_PLATFORM_FT4222 -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=[EVE graphics] -DEVE_APPS_DISPLAY=[EVE display] -DEVE_APPS_SPI=[EVE SPI] -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
nmake SampleApp_[Project Name]

# EVE_APPS_PLATFORM can be one of : EVE_PLATFORM_FT4222 or EVE_PLATFORM_MPSSE
# [EVE graphics] must be : EVE_GRAPHICS_BT820
# [EVE display] can be one of:  EVE_DISPLAY_WUXGA (1920x1200 LCD), EVE_DISPLAY_FHD (1920x1080 LCD)
# [EVE SPI] can be one of : EVE_SPI_QUAD, EVE_SPI_DUAL, EVE_SPI_SINGLE  (FT4222 can support Quad/Dual/Single, MPSSE supports single only)
# [Project Name] is the folder name of a subfolder inside SampleApp , one example is SampleApp_Widget
# The output binary [Project Name].exe can be found in build\[Project Name]

One example is :
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DEVE_APPS_PLATFORM=EVE_PLATFORM_FT4222 -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=EVE_GRAPHICS_BT820 -DEVE_APPS_DISPLAY=EVE_DISPLAY_WUXGA -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```

### Raspberry Pi Pico

Requires the Pico toolchain https://github.com/ndabas/pico-setup-windows to be installed.

Pico-SDK version 1.3.0 is required


The following steps will build for Raspberry Pi Pico.

 1. Install cmake 3.19.x, python, Visual Studio 2019 community (must select C++), GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain for window.
 2. Launch the *Developer Command Prompt for VS*
```sh
set PICO_SDK_PATH=[path to pico-sdk]
set PICO_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=[path to GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain\\10 2020-q4-major\\bin]
cd EveApps
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DEVE_APPS_PLATFORM=EVE_PLATFORM_RP2040 -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=[EVE graphics] -DEVE_APPS_DISPLAY=[EVE display] -DEVE_APPS_SPI=[EVE SPI] -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
nmake [Project name]

# [EVE graphics] must be : EVE_GRAPHICS_BT820
# [EVE display] can be one of:  EVE_DISPLAY_WUXGA (1920x1200 LCD), EVE_DISPLAY_FHD (1920x1080 LCD)
# [EVE SPI] must : EVE_SPI_SINGLE (PR2040 supports single only)
# [Project Name] is the folder name of a subfolder inside SampleApp , one example is SampleApp_Widget
# The output binary [Project Name].uf2 can be found in build\SampleApp\[Project]
```

Example: 
```
$ cmake.exe -G "NMake Makefiles"  -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=EVE_GRAPHICS_BT820 -DEVE_APPS_PLATFORM=MM2040EV -DEVE_APPS_DISPLAY=EVE_DISPLAY_WUXGA -DEVE_APPS_SPI=EVE_SPI_SINGLE -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
